# AI Sustainable Secret Santa with Pyhton
## An easy, anonymous and sustaible Secret Santa
This program should allow you to anonymously assign Secret Santas and inform the Secret Santas of their recipients by mail. This is done by collecting personal inforamtion along gift wishes with a google survey. By adding gift wishes and themes like sustainability, this program makes sure, that less presents end up in the bin directly after christmas. In conlusion, this program is set to make your Secret Santa organization easier, more anonymously and sustainable.

### 4) Copy the link into the code as described in the code

### 5) Share the survey with your friends and family

### 6) After everybody has filled out the form, run the code

### 7) Have fun during christmas 

## Further adjustments you can make

### 1) Change the picture that is send with the email. 
For that follow the instructions in the emailing part of the code
### 2) Change the text in the mail
If you want to rephrase the email you can do that in that easily in the html code in the emailing part of the script. Be aware of the pyhton for loop that runs through the html code so everybody still gets an individualized email. You can also remind people of the budget you chose as a group
### 3) Change the survey
You can change the survey but do not change the first questions regarding names and email address. Make sure, that the for loop which goes over the html code in the emailing part still works and the email makes sense!
